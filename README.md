Control of pending registration of parts.

Challenges:
- Clean and self-explanatory graphics
- Graphic in seaborn with multiple index
- Grouping of pending issues when the pending is for more than one person

In the execution, the user only needs to generate the excel spreadsheet by SAP and the python notebook generates the pending graphs.

Note: The spreadsheet data has been modified so as not to expose the company's data
